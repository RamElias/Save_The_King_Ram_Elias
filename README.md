# Save_The_King_Ram_Elias
Thinking game project in OOP course. using SFML.




A nice thinking game where the king has to reach the throne.
During the game there are several characters whose goal is to help the king reach his destination.
The witch eats the fire, the warrior kills the orc and the thief opens the gates with keys.
In advanced stages of the game there is a dragon that chases the king and if he manages to touch it the player lost.
Moving the characters in the game using the arrow keys and changing the character you want to move with using the P key.

Enjoy!
